Code for the paper titled: Enhancing Diesel Engine Performance: Utilizing Artificial Neural Networks to Model Thermochemical Properties of PODE Fuel

Abstract
The use of Polyoxymethylene Dimethyl Ether (PODE) as a renewable fuel and its potential to improve diesel engine performance by reducing soot emissions has been extensively discussed in literature. However, effectively simulating engine performance using this alternative fuel requires complex Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, which can be computationally expensive when using detailed chemical mechanisms. Therefore, to address this issue, the study proposes a model that utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), to model detailed chemistry while reducing computational costs. The MLP models are trained to represent the thermochemical properties of the fuel-air mixture and can interpolate states not explicitly covered in the simulation. The method involves precomputing thermochemical states through auto-ignition simulations and categorizing them into four regimes based on their temporal evolution within combustion. Separate MLP models are then constructed and trained for each regime. Validation of the method involves evaluating the accuracy of predicted curves compared to those generated by the auto-ignition simulations and assessing the reproduction of Ignition Delays (IDs). The results demonstrate good agreement between predicted thermochemical parameters and IDs, indicating the model's precision in representing detailed mechanisms. Additionally, the method is compared to the Global Reaction Mechanism (GRM), showing promising results and suggesting its potential for adaptation to other fuels.
